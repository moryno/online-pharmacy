## Description

---

_medicine_ is an online pharmacy web application meant to be help patients find their medication and health products with ease. The client can browse and see any product when they land on the page, they can choose products by category, they can select a product and be redirected to a single page where they can read more about it. In the single page they can also read reviews about the product from other usersand also be able to leave of their own about the product.

_medicine_ has both the client side and the admin dashboard. The clients who are not registered can view the product and add product to cart but they need authentication to checkout. To get athentication a user has to register if they dont have an account then register or if they have an account they can login and they will be issued with an access token that will allow them to leave a review on a product or checkout the cart.

_admin_ has all the authority to visit any part of the site plus they can visit the admin dashboard. In the dashboard they can create, delete, update, fetch all the products. They can also see all the orders and see all the users who have registered to the site.

This is a _medicine_ website with a front-end made using React and a backend made with Ruby and Rails, and Postgresql. Rails and Postgress allowed us to create five models, _User_, _Product_, _Order_, _Cart_ and _Review_ that could communicate with the database. In each model if where we defined our macro associations.

Rails helped in creating api endpoints that could be used by React frontend to get, post, delete and update the products and its associates.

The front-end is diployed in [vercel](https://vercel.com/) hosting service while the Sinatra is hosted in [heroku](https://heroku.com/).
